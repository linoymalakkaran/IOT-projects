## Design Justification

### Network Design

The network architecture is designed to support 1 million+ IoT water meters while ensuring high availability, security, and low-power operation:

1. **LoRaWAN as Primary Connectivity**
   - Ideal for battery-operated devices with 5-10 year battery life
   - Long-range coverage (up to 15km in rural areas)
   - Low bandwidth requirements align perfectly with water meter data needs
   - Cost-effective for large-scale deployments

2. **Cellular (LTE-M/NB-IoT) as Backup**
   - Provides redundancy in critical areas
   - Lower power consumption than standard LTE
   - Ensures connectivity where LoRaWAN coverage may be challenging

3. **Multi-Tier Gateway Architecture**
   - Distributed gateways ensure coverage across urban and semi-urban areas
   - Edge processing reduces cloud data transmission and enables local control
   - Meets <2-second latency requirement for valve control

4. **Redundant Network Paths**
   - Overlapping gateway coverage ensures 99.9% availability
   - Failover mechanisms between connectivity options
